# Patient Meow

They say there used to be a thriving city here...

## Digging for clues

You made it into the lab of the Chicago CDC office. 

_Patient Zero_ couldn't remember much about the day when everything changed fro them. They were at a secret cat cafe, and when they were walking back to their car 
the were scratched by an orange looking cat. They were unsure of the exact name of the secret cafe she was at, but it sounded like "Cafe Pawsome".

```r

ask_patient(c("cafe paws"))

find_cafe("cafe_paws")


```
